      <h1>My Work</h1>
      <p>I started working as a Full Stack Developer in Stateside.</p>

      <hr />
      <p>Then, a new opportunity came out, to learn new things and embrace new challenges, so I accepted a job as a Software Engineer at Avantica, where I currently work.</p>
      <img src="./assets/logo.jpg" width="140px" />
      <p>Besides that, I'm always willing to start new personal projects, to create new things, and to keep learning.</p>
